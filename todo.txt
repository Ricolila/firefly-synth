on release:
update kvr
update screenshots
dont forget to tag
upload new binaries
update the history
check if need update github social preview
drop all conversion code on breaking plugin id
dont forget to update the version nr in code and cmake and mac bundle

sometimes:
update hosts
cpu/mem profiling

someday:
mseg
midi mpe
microtonal
.com website 
cheby shaper
voice level unison
cakewalk bug report
phaser/flanger/chorus
incorporate mts-esp
vst3 note expressions
clap (poly) modulation
visual routing indicators
document the header files a bit
basic osc waveform icons
solo osc/fx
out gain/cpu meter
do visual am/fm demo
normalized_to_raw/plain => no need to trigger the exponential conversion stuff on each sample, just when automation/modulation changed
=> how ? if done in plugin_base, lose out on inlining, if done in firefly, needs more scratch space

v1.6:
Fix all the Mac font heights
Fix all the todos
Do we need to FTZ/DAZ?

v1.7:
bug: preset select jumps back to previous
do forward compat checks - dont load newer versions
automate zip/dist
do async clear delay lines etc on patch select -> 
  idea: since all the reset/reload stuff seems kinda fuzzy and different between clap/vst3:
  add a hidden readonly int parameter acting as a random token and flush stuff on the dsp side when it changes?

other:
CLAP gui not showing on qtractor/fedora
do indexed release schema + regular backwards compat
