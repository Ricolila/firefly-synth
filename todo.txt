clap polyphonic modulation
full-blown renoise support

Feedback FM - but needs per-sample processing, not block
turn on stuff when dragging (e.g. basic sin, dist skew etc)
arpeggiator - hard - but easy -> play multiple octaves on-note. or maybe allow 3/s, 5/s, whatever selection

wishlist sometime:
mseg
midi mpe
.com website 
cheby shaper
phaser/flanger/chorus
vst3 note expressions
