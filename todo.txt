sometimes:
update hosts
update submodules
cpu/mem profiling

9 check if need update github social preview
10 mail to self
11 merge back

microtuning:
* check up on andreyas comments

autobuilds:
* ask paul
* integrate https://github.com/surge-synthesizer/monique-monosynth/blob/main/.github/workflows/build-pr.yml

mseg:
V paint left right
V select env length time/bars
V disable regular env stuff when mseg
draw the grid
deal with the dsp
deal with retrigger etc
do the actual editing
snap to grid ?
what can be modulated ?
do sustain marker
mseg as lfo
see if we can paint the vcv matrices more often based on static stuff
same for vlfo/venv ==> stick to last note or something ?
vlfo smooth not paint good (prolly looking for note rand?)
why does it keep on dirtying the graph state?
better defaults
do sustain/release on env + all the mono-mode stuff
make the mseg editor react to automation (but NOT modulation!_)
thoroughly test the case when we add/rem points! 
fix the undo stuff
recheck all the set_raw/plain_at blah, should be moved through gui_param_etc
test the heck out of it in debug
show tooltips on hover ie what are we editing

make a patch cleanup button
update the routing graph for arp

ditch after-mod, claim micro support ?
arp new note = reset table pos yes/no?
do more keyboard tracking just do it -- also trackmode mul/add
do global unison subvoice index as a mod source
turn on stuff when dragging (e.g. basic sin, dist skew etc)

mseg:
- for lfo
- for env + sustain point
- update the mode description in the gui


wishlist:
use fftw
should figure out a way to do user supplied formulas?
update the manuals routing overview image with new colors
filter micro tuning
DSF falloff to the left
clap polyphonic modulation
full-blown renoise support
fix global unison for mono mode
show effective modulation in the ui for clap param mod
Feedback FM - but needs per-sample processing, not block

wishlist sometime:
mseg
midi mpe
cheby shaper
phaser/flanger/chorus
vst3 note expressions
flstudio clap support
show clap mod indicator
visual routing indicators
automated regression tests
better studiorack integration
do async clear delay lines etc on patch select
