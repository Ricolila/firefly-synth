sometimes:
update hosts
update submodules
cpu/mem profiling

on release: 
1 dont forget to update the version nr in code and cmake and mac bundle and build/zip scripts and studiorack and site
2 drop all conversion code on breaking plugin id
3 run some debug builds
4 add missing presets from demos
5 update all renoise stuff
6 upload new binaries
7 update screenshots
8 update the history
9 check if need update github social preview
10 mail to self
11 merge back
12 dont forget to tag
13 make a github release
14 update kvr 
15 update the website (vimexx)

microtuning:
* check up on andreyas comments

autobuilds:
* ask paul
* integrate https://github.com/surge-synthesizer/monique-monosynth/blob/main/.github/workflows/build-pr.yml

mseg:
V paint left right
V select env length time/bars
V disable regular env stuff when mseg
V swap x/y for slope
V limit the point count
V double click slope = linear 
V do value in tooltip
V drag x
V disable x for modulation if is count - 1 plus fix it in the dsp to be sure
V fishy stuff with undo
V show tooltips on hover ie what are we editing
V fix the undo stuff
V recheck all the set_raw/plain_at blah, should be moved through gui_param_etc
V do the actual editing
V deal with the dsp
V up the vno
V do host context menu for params
V what can be modulated ?
V better defaults
V make the mseg editor react to automation (but NOT modulation!_)
V test the heck out of it in debug
V thoroughly test the case when we add/rem points! 
X disable stuff based on point count and last
X allow more slope, but - do we need to convert the existing env ?
V bigass editor do background title
V bigass editor tooltip no workie
V do external editor
V draw the grid
V do sustain marker
V right click not work in renoise
V deal with retrigger etc
V do sustain/release on env + all the mono-mode stuff
X why does it keep on dirtying the graph state?
X see if we can paint the vcv matrices more often based on static stuff
X same for vlfo/venv ==> stick to last note or something ?
X vlfo smooth not paint good (prolly looking for note rand?)
V do the actual snapping

do a couple test files
do docs

shortlist:
mseg as lfo
do the kvr arm64 thing
ditch after-mod, claim micro support ?
arp new note = reset table pos yes/no?
do more keyboard tracking just do it -- also trackmode mul/add
do global unison subvoice index as a mod source
turn on stuff when dragging (e.g. basic sin, dist skew etc)

wishlist:
use fftw
should figure out a way to do user supplied formulas?
update the manuals routing overview image with new colors
make a patch cleanup button
update the routing graph for arp
filter micro tuning
DSF falloff to the left
clap polyphonic modulation
full-blown renoise support
fix global unison for mono mode
show effective modulation in the ui for clap param mod
Feedback FM - but needs per-sample processing, not block

wishlist sometime:
midi mpe
cheby shaper
phaser/flanger/chorus
vst3 note expressions
flstudio clap support
show clap mod indicator
visual routing indicators
automated regression tests
better studiorack integration
do async clear delay lines etc on patch select
