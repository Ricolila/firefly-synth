microtuning:
* check up on andreyas comments

autobuilds:
* ask paul
* sign the mac version
* integrate https://github.com/surge-synthesizer/monique-monosynth/blob/main/.github/workflows/build-pr.yml

shortlist:
visual mod demo is borked in new reaper for vst3 only (also on 193)
ditch after-mod, claim micro support ?
do more keyboard tracking just do it -- also trackmode mul/add
do global unison subvoice index as a mod source
turn on stuff when dragging (e.g. basic sin, dist skew etc)
switch juce to direct2d once it gets better (fonts are ugly, checkboxes have severe aliasing)
juce::font::getstringwidth is deprecated, but the alternative is slow as molasses, keep taps on https://forum.juce.com/t/juce-8-0-2-glypharrangement-slow-in-debug-builds/63702

wishlist:
use fftw
should figure out a way to do user supplied formulas?
update the manuals routing overview image with new colors
make a patch cleanup button
update the routing graph for arp
filter micro tuning
DSF falloff to the left
clap polyphonic modulation
full-blown renoise support
fix global unison for mono mode
show effective modulation in the ui for clap param mod
Feedback FM - but needs per-sample processing, not block

wishlist sometime:
midi mpe
cheby shaper
phaser/flanger/chorus
vst3 note expressions
show clap mod indicator
visual routing indicators
automated regression tests
better studiorack integration
do async clear delay lines etc on patch select
glfo + snap + phase > 0.5 not ok
