mseg
.com website 
microtonal
voice level unison
cakewalk bug report
visual routing indicators
midi mpe
vst3 note expressions
clap (poly) modulation
document the header files a bit

v1.1:
fx-only version
implement monophonic mode
implement envelope retriggering

demo synth:
read all the comments from github and kvr and forums
check all infernal functionality, see what needs to be in the base
do the param fuzz test
auto-generate the manual (param list)
document all the context menus
document new invisible stuff (bpm/midi smooth, comb/delay lin interpol) 
make example presets for all functionality (staircase osc, per-uni-voice AM, distortion etc etc, stereo-noise)
write the infernal<>firefly comparison
credit the image
test win/lin clap/vst reaper/fruity/bitwig
document that fm only works for phase generators
place the vst3 compatible logo somewhere
put the plug format in the header (vst/clap)
linux release buildfiles end up in the debug folder? the binary is release mode still
linux build is NOT avx, document that

* get some linux folks to comment (ycollete?)
* continuing
- check the todos
- do parameter table with function descriptions and automation/modulation/per-voice etc
- profile performance + memory +  maybe do cpu efficient versions (non-sloped ramps etc)
- check all param_automate
- keep updating the demo stuff

* host bugs:
- waveform: lots, not supported
- cakewalk, renoise: ui interaction gets lost (does not end up as inputParameterChanges) (also for load state from ui)
