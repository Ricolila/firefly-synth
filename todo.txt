(polyphonic) modulation
handle clap midi notes
handle clap is_modulatable
get the graphs in there, see what adsr does
handle automation changes at voice vs block start
on-note/hold-type cv
do cakewalk bug report
test all host+linux
param value dependent on other param

demo synth:
graphs
velocity + note as modsource
on-note type stuff
do clap midi notes
polymod/mpe/note_exprs
midi note as mod source
read all the comments from github and kvr and forums
audio output graph
any output graph
swap module incl swap routing
make new test files
react graphs to mouseover

* get some linux folks to comment (ycollete?)
* continuing
- measure performance
- keep updating the demo tracks

* host bugs:
- waveform: lots, not supported
- cakewalk, renoise: ui interaction gets lost (does not end up as inputParameterChanges) (also for load state from ui)
