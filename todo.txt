v1.7.8 clap polymod
- flip autosmt/other smt
- polymod
- monophonic mode polymod
- how does this work with global unison?
- allow to disable env 1, use external env ?

v1.7.9:
flstudio beta CLAP automation test is broken, retest when the thing is released
do not include plugin version in the name, waveform seeks for it
do automated tests somehow
retest bitwig clap resizing
bug: preset select jumps back to previous
do forward compat checks - dont load newer versions
do async clear delay lines etc on patch select -> 
  idea: since all the reset/reload stuff seems kinda fuzzy and different between clap/vst3:
  add a hidden readonly int parameter acting as a random token and flush stuff on the dsp side when it changes?

other:
CLAP gui not showing on qtractor/fedora
do indexed release schema + regular backwards compat
