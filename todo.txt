make a .com website 

someday:
mseg
microtonal support
polyphonic modulation
do cakewalk bug report
handle clap is_modulatable

demo synth:
handle clap midi notes
do clap midi notes
polymod/mpe/note_exprs
read all the comments from github and kvr and forums
make new test files
fix up the gui (control sizes etc)
check all infernal functionality, see what needs to be in the base
document the header files a bit
implement the multi env
poly/poly port sync/poly port time/mono port sync/mono port time (fake mono only)
voice arp?
more flexibility in plugin_base -> "give me a voice"
hardsync, unison
do 5 am and 5 fm routes 
do add_submenu everywhere in the topos
osc: overlay any 2 waves ? (saw+saw==>pulse)
fix the init patch
do "IR" as variable length
prettify the matrix section
logify the shaper gain
do all trig + clip/tan as waveshapers
foldback + cheby shaper
waveshaper autodc ==> better autodc using min/max/avg + scale not clip
"insert route before/after" ==> enable it !
still find a way to do insert fx here
oversample the whole thing ?
do hpf in waveshaper (dc fix)
do the param fuzz test
figure out if we have a decent option set that covers both lfos and shapers (e.g, can we emulate foldback)
do 4 auxs
drop trig header

fix the comb size param
* fx
* stvar - freq, res, gain, kbd
* comb - g+ d+ g- d-
* shape - over, gain, mix, terms/decay ?
* 

* get some linux folks to comment (ycollete?)
* continuing
- do parameter table with function descriptions and automation/modulation/per-voice etc
- profile performance + maybe do cpu efficient versions (non-sloped ramps etc)
- check all param_automate
- keep updating the demo stuff

* host bugs:
- waveform: lots, not supported
- cakewalk, renoise: ui interaction gets lost (does not end up as inputParameterChanges) (also for load state from ui)
