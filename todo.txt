always:
dont forget to tag
update the history
keep cpu/mem profiling

someday:
mseg
midi mpe
microtonal
.com website 
voice level unison
cakewalk bug report
phaser/flanger/chorus
incorporate mts-esp
vst3 note expressions
clap (poly) modulation
visual routing indicators
document the header files a bit

v1.2:
automate zip/dist
move route up/down
copy voice<->global
osc graph does not vertical fill?
do copy/paste patch through clipboard
bug: preset select jumps back to previous
do async clear delay lines etc on patch select
do forward compat checks - dont load newer versions
do a dry/wet control on the comb filter so i can get rid of the transient amplifier at start

small-ui-changes:
do icons for the osc modes
do some more margin between the controls
do basic theming support (e.g. config file with colors)
label all unlabeled stuff (mostly comboboxes)
split the distortion gui over 2 rows its too crowded
right-align tempo synced comboboxes (and possibly others)
make checkbox and combobox less prominent on screen
make the whole ui a bit larger for slightly bigger knobs
make the left side a bit wider so we dont need to abbreviate labels so much
divide the matrix tab header over 2 rows so we dont need abbreviations for gm.cv etc
get rid of the "combined" comboboxes, just make them separate parameters (breaking change!)


other:
profile the pad preset
CLAP gui not showing on qtractor/fedora
do indexed release schema + regular backwards compat
