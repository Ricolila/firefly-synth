make a .com website 

someday:
mseg
voice arp
microtonal support
do voice level unison
clap mod + polymod + mpe + note_exprs
do cakewalk bug report
visual routing indicators
document the header files a bit

demo synth:
make sure everything accurate can modulate
do fx version
read all the comments from github and kvr and forums
check all infernal functionality, see what needs to be in the base
implement the multi env
poly/poly port sync/poly port time/mono port sync/mono port time (fake mono only)
more flexibility in plugin_base -> "give me a voice"
do 5 am and 5 fm routes 
do add_submenu everywhere in the topos
fix the init patch
prettify the matrix section
do the param fuzz test
at least block-automate all voice parameters see also modmatrices
auto-generate the manual (param list)
document all the context menus
document new invisible stuff (bpm/midi smooth, comb/delay lin interpol) 
do osc oversampling
make example presets for all functionality (staircase osc, per-uni-voice AM, distortion etc etc, stereo-noise)
write the infernal<>firefly comparison
check all the sample rates where needs oversmp
access the oversampled buffer for AM through context ptr
fix oversampling + am (move into over stage)
move oversmp to voice in, seems undoable to modulate mixed-oversmp-factor oscs

* get some linux folks to comment (ycollete?)
* continuing
- check the todos
- do parameter table with function descriptions and automation/modulation/per-voice etc
- profile performance + memory +  maybe do cpu efficient versions (non-sloped ramps etc)
- check all param_automate
- keep updating the demo stuff

* host bugs:
- waveform: lots, not supported
- cakewalk, renoise: ui interaction gets lost (does not end up as inputParameterChanges) (also for load state from ui)
