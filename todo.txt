make a .com website 

someday:
mseg
microtonal support
polyphonic modulation
do cakewalk bug report
handle clap is_modulatable
do temposync in both beats and bars
dont assume host is on a 4/4 timesig

demo synth:
handle clap midi notes
do clap midi notes
polymod/mpe/note_exprs
read all the comments from github and kvr and forums
make new test files
fix up the gui (control sizes etc)
check all infernal functionality, see what needs to be in the base
document the header files a bit
more space for freq slider
number modules by processing order or by group
implement the multi env
poly/poly port sync/poly port time/mono port sync/mono port time (fake mono only)
do incdecbuttons on cent?
voice arp?
more flexibility in plugin_base -> "give me a voice"
hardsync, unison
do 5 am and 5 fm routes
drop "or time into scratch" & friends?
do skew by log for lfo's too
env synced partition as synced
do ramped (skew - phase) lfos

lfo:
- phase control for non-rand
- off/rate/sync/rate One/sync One
- waveform select + rand controls (freerun etc) + filter
- rate/tempo
- x/y slope controls


* get some linux folks to comment (ycollete?)
* continuing
- profile performance + maybe do cpu efficient versions (non-sloped ramps etc)
- check all param_automate
- keep updating the demo stuff

* host bugs:
- waveform: lots, not supported
- cakewalk, renoise: ui interaction gets lost (does not end up as inputParameterChanges) (also for load state from ui)
