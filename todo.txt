make a .com website 

someday:
mseg
microtonal support
polyphonic modulation
do cakewalk bug report
handle clap is_modulatable (not yet per note)
make sure everything accurate can modulate

demo synth:
do fx version
handle clap midi notes
do clap midi notes
polymod/mpe/note_exprs
read all the comments from github and kvr and forums
make new test files
fix up the gui (control sizes etc)
check all infernal functionality, see what needs to be in the base
document the header files a bit
implement the multi env
poly/poly port sync/poly port time/mono port sync/mono port time (fake mono only)
voice arp?
more flexibility in plugin_base -> "give me a voice"
hardsync, unison
do 5 am and 5 fm routes 
do add_submenu everywhere in the topos
osc: overlay any 2 waves ? (saw+saw==>pulse)
fix the init patch
prettify the matrix section
"insert route before/after" ==> enable it !
still find a way to do insert fx here
do the param fuzz test
at least block-automate all voice parameters see also modmatrices
re-profile the kbdtest demo
do global "clear unused" context menu entry ?
auto-generate the manual (param list)
visual routing indicators ?
document all the context menus
document new invisible stuff (bpm/midi smooth, comb/delay lin interpol) 
smooth random as osc? probably not
lightweight theming (per user config file only)
do phase modulation & freq modulation
lerped hardsync
check all the automated names in the host
not oscillator/envelope=>osc/env, it is annoying in host browser, expose short param names
drop automate_modulate, makes no sense
do osc pm/fm
do osc oversampling
special case 0x oversampling
template the domain type conversion
reverb size exponential
do everything normalized_to_raw, dont rely on normalized values being identity

* get some linux folks to comment (ycollete?)
* continuing
- do parameter table with function descriptions and automation/modulation/per-voice etc
- profile performance + memory +  maybe do cpu efficient versions (non-sloped ramps etc)
- check all param_automate
- keep updating the demo stuff

* host bugs:
- waveform: lots, not supported
- cakewalk, renoise: ui interaction gets lost (does not end up as inputParameterChanges) (also for load state from ui)
