(polyphonic) modulation
handle clap midi notes
handle clap is_modulatable
handle automation changes at voice vs block start
do cakewalk bug report

demo synth:
do clap midi notes
polymod/mpe/note_exprs
read all the comments from github and kvr and forums
make new test files
fix up the gui (control sizes etc)
check all infernal functionality, see what needs to be in the base
document the header files a bit
negative cv amount
fully do the cv matrix with offset/spread
more space for freq slider
number modules by processing order or by group
poly/poly port sync/poly port time/mono port sync/mono port time (fake mono only)
do incdecbuttons on cent?
voice arp?
more flexibility in plugin_base -> "give me a voice"
hardsync, unison
do 5 am and 5 fm routes
make all stuff visible / not tabbed
do "with audio/cv/all routing"
double check all routing menu handlers
prevent routing handlers from making invalid gui values
check all param_automate
env slope name in tooltip
make most cv automate/block only? ==> only time-de pendent
undo/redo stack
why automate block params at all ? ==> choose max flexibility that makes sence ?
rethink automate/modulate -> maybe only need 3 ? off / block (both step/real) and accurate (real and implies modulate)
--> or maybe only need 2? off = only ui (real or step), on = full-blown automate-modulate (real only)
--> no, block/step params may be automatable (e.g. turn on an extra oscillator)
===>> just make a matrix and see what combos make sense
do mseg someday
drop domain.default_selector, leave it to init_minimal
do only simplified timesigs
dim comboboxes a bit (not full-scale white)
do different ui layout, larges graphs, load/save/preset etc on 1 line below graphs
do "insert fx" menu option

* get some linux folks to comment (ycollete?)
* continuing
- measure performance
- keep updating the demo stuff

* host bugs:
- waveform: lots, not supported
- cakewalk, renoise: ui interaction gets lost (does not end up as inputParameterChanges) (also for load state from ui)
