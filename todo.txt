sometimes:
update hosts
update submodules
cpu/mem profiling

on release: 
1 dont forget to update the version nr in code and cmake and mac bundle and build/zip scripts and studiorack
2 drop all conversion code on breaking plugin id
3 run some debug builds
4 add missing presets from demos
5 update all renoise stuff
6 upload new binaries
7 update screenshots
8 update the history
9 check if need update github social preview
10 dont forget to tag
11 make a github release
12 update kvr 

microtuning:
* check up on andreyas comments

autobuilds:
* ask paul
* integrate https://github.com/surge-synthesizer/monique-monosynth/blob/main/.github/workflows/build-pr.yml

modvis take 3:
V shit is super expensive again so do another profiling session ==> oh nee toch niet dat was debug mode
V the 1 second timer to copy from automation state is actually visible ==> oh nee toch niet dat was debug mode
V stuff goes not good when cv->cv mod by free-rand
V extra retest the multi-slot cv matrix
V the cv-audio graph is acting weird
V free-running lfos
V also for voice
V fix the distribution
V also test the on-note-sampling of glfo
V also test the on-note (static) random
V per-voice-rand-seed
V fix the envs -> not render highest voice index but latest start time
V fix the cv paint for envs
V recheck the osci->osci am/fm graph modulation goes it still good?
V retest the oneshot lfos
V retest the legato/retrig envs
V fix all also for the cv graphs
* add a this-is-here-indicator for the cv graph (maybe just a bolletje on the linkerkant)
* retest everything once the code seems stable
* add note key and velo as vismods also midi
* test the clap
* retest all the graphs
* retest all the osci rand modes
* retest all random osci / kps

wishlist:
global aux 6 not fit cvaudio gui
make a patch cleanup button
update the manuals routing overview image with new colors
filter microtuning
DSF falloff to the left
clap polyphonic modulation
full-blown renoise support
fix global unison for mono mode
ditch after-mod, claim micro support ?
show effective modulation in the ui for clap param mod
Feedback FM - but needs per-sample processing, not block
turn on stuff when dragging (e.g. basic sin, dist skew etc)
arpeggiator - hard - but easy -> play multiple octaves on-note. or maybe allow 3/s, 5/s, whatever selection
bugfix: rerender graph on master in param hover?
repaint on waveform change (free running or random-per-voice)

wishlist sometime:
mseg
midi mpe
.com website 
cheby shaper
phaser/flanger/chorus
vst3 note expressions
flstudio clap support
show clap mod indicator
visual routing indicators
automated regression tests
better studiorack integration
do async clear delay lines etc on patch select
global unit lfo phase offset not plot good
