wishlist:
bugfix: rerender graph on master in param hover?
turn on stuff when dragging (e.g. basic sin, dist skew etc)
drop some ugly-ass themes
filter microtuning
DSF falloff to the left
clap polyphonic modulation
full-blown renoise support
fix global unison for mono mode
show effective modulation in the ui for clap param mod
Feedback FM - but needs per-sample processing, not block
turn on stuff when dragging (e.g. basic sin, dist skew etc)
arpeggiator - hard - but easy -> play multiple octaves on-note. or maybe allow 3/s, 5/s, whatever selection
