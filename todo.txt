make a .com website 

someday:
mseg
microtonal support
polyphonic modulation
do cakewalk bug report
handle clap is_modulatable (not yet per note)
make sure everything accurate can modulate

demo synth:
do fx version
handle clap midi notes
do clap midi notes
polymod/mpe/note_exprs
read all the comments from github and kvr and forums
make new test files
check all infernal functionality, see what needs to be in the base
document the header files a bit
implement the multi env
poly/poly port sync/poly port time/mono port sync/mono port time (fake mono only)
voice arp?
more flexibility in plugin_base -> "give me a voice"
hardsync, unison
do 5 am and 5 fm routes 
do add_submenu everywhere in the topos
fix the init patch
prettify the matrix section
do the param fuzz test
at least block-automate all voice parameters see also modmatrices
auto-generate the manual (param list)
visual routing indicators ?
document all the context menus
document new invisible stuff (bpm/midi smooth, comb/delay lin interpol) 
lerped hardsync
do osc oversampling
do voice level unison

* get some linux folks to comment (ycollete?)
* continuing
- check the todos
- do parameter table with function descriptions and automation/modulation/per-voice etc
- profile performance + memory +  maybe do cpu efficient versions (non-sloped ramps etc)
- check all param_automate
- keep updating the demo stuff

* host bugs:
- waveform: lots, not supported
- cakewalk, renoise: ui interaction gets lost (does not end up as inputParameterChanges) (also for load state from ui)
