V do off/block/voice tuning
V do NOT use the tuning table when "Off", or - make sure it gives the same results with lerp
V deal with monophonic modes
V check the alignment 
V rename note_to_freq=>no_tuning, select version based on template params
V ask oli about the possibility to do 1 IPC call for the entire tuning table
V fix the tuning table at block start, copy over the whole thing at voice start, before threadpool kicks in -- and link it 1:1 to tuning mode.
V do NOT requery tuning mode anywhere else except where the actual table is filled !
V tuning -> retuning. reserve tuning for interpolation mode
V figure out how to interpolate/modulate
V test the heck out of the clap threadpool
- better defaults
- disable tunmode when timing is off
- do something with mts_hasmaster
- no need to requery on inner block size, just outer
- deal with unmapped keys
- show mts status in output section
- fix the renoise demos
- refix all the patches
- deal with kbdtrack and anything else that might be affected
- not forget to install the dynlib on mac/lin
- fix the todos
- yes or no on per-channel retuning ?
- load mapping files within firefly itself yes/no?
- check if fx still works without retuning support

wishlist:
green-on-white UI
DSF falloff to the left

Feedback FM - but needs per-sample processing, not block
turn on stuff when dragging (e.g. basic sin, dist skew etc)
