always:
dont forget to tag
update the history
keep cpu/mem profiling
dont forget to update the version nr in code and cmake

someday:
mseg
midi mpe
microtonal
.com website 
voice level unison
cakewalk bug report
phaser/flanger/chorus
incorporate mts-esp
vst3 note expressions
clap (poly) modulation
visual routing indicators
document the header files a bit

v1.2:
automate zip/dist
move route up/down
copy voice<->global
osc graph does not vertical fill?
do copy/paste patch through clipboard
bug: preset select jumps back to previous
do async clear delay lines etc on patch select
do forward compat checks - dont load newer versions

small-ui-changes:
bigger vertical modulation graph
check module header sizes
todo drop the dot-notation
check all the todos
check the reference generator output
check all the short/long names + also in menus
now have room for cheby shaper/smooth random?
re-read the param docs and manual
check all the tooltips and names in matrices
see if its possible to expand combobox text values
do large labels as much as possible
do gain meter for master out gain?
check the fx-version ui layout
test all the host demos
update the demo tracks
dont forget to convert on split lfo params
document the changes
retest all presets and demo tracks and host tests
fix up all the presets
check the fx version
keep track of the matrices layout
check which colors are still used
check all the short names in the matrices
do icons for the osc modes?
group cv matrix targets by e.g. gaudio gain 1-10
do basic theming support (e.g. config file with colors)
label all unlabeled stuff (mostly comboboxes)
right-align tempo synced comboboxes (and possibly others)
make the whole ui a bit larger for slightly bigger knobs
divide the matrix tab header over 2 rows so we dont need abbreviations for gm.cv etc
get rid of the "combined" comboboxes, just make them separate parameters (breaking change!)

other:
redo cheby shaper?
profile the pad preset
CLAP gui not showing on qtractor/fedora
do indexed release schema + regular backwards compat
