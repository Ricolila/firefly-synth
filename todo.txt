1.8.3 drag-drop
v allow drag with alternate param (ie basic sine amt) -> link param to other param
v also do param_value_label
v hover over matrix tab = select it
v allow drag f.e. dist skewx 
v better paint what is being dragged (see eg osc 1)
v drag the module headers if they have audio/cv outs
v osc src/tgt is ugly
V the order is still wrong (drag vfx6 as audio target)
* do validation
* drag aux1 = drag cv signal, not the button
* drag all matrices -> check all sources and targets in the matrices
* can_modulate doesn't cut it anymore, we now need can_modulate_by_host and can_module_by_host_and_mod_matrix
* filter out invalid combis eg glfo1 to glfo1 rate
* cannot drag voice out/mout

wishlist:
DSF falloff to the left
clap polyphonic modulation
full-blown renoise support
fix global unison for mono mode
fixed random at voice start as mod source
Feedback FM - but needs per-sample processing, not block
arpeggiator - hard - but easy -> play multiple octaves on-note. or maybe allow 3/s, 5/s, whatever selection

wishlist sometime:
mseg
midi mpe
microtonal
.com website 
cheby shaper
incorporate mts-esp
phaser/flanger/chorus
vst3 note expressions
flstudio clap support
visual routing indicators
automated regression tests
better studiorack integration
