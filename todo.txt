sometimes:
update hosts
update submodules
cpu/mem profiling

on release: 
1 dont forget to update the version nr in code and cmake and mac bundle and build/zip scripts and studiorack
2 drop all conversion code on breaking plugin id
3 run some debug builds
4 add missing presets from demos
5 update all renoise stuff
6 upload new binaries
7 update screenshots
8 update the history
9 check if need update github social preview
10 dont forget to tag
11 make a github release
12 update kvr 

microtuning:
* check up on andreyas comments

autobuilds:
* ask paul
* integrate https://github.com/surge-synthesizer/monique-monosynth/blob/main/.github/workflows/build-pr.yml

ui-vnext:
V show active modulation for the other graphs -> better to have a separate state copy including modulation
V todo show all voices or only last
V just fix the intermittent stuff by a timer on the gui side to reset to automation, too bad, too complicated
V see up :: shit i still need param_was_modded_this_round/voice, otherwise stuff sticks
V also do the audio matrix graphs
V also include the mod-mod matrix events
V make the cv graphs + bolletjes work in case of automation
V fix the clap / limit the q
V am bells clap reaper plots not good the cv-audio matrix
X maybe just paint all of graphs on 60 fps ?
V test with disable/enable routes (param_is_modded event)
X less ugly audio graphs
V not always paint the first matrix row
V make some options in the gui to draw mod or not
V profile the whole thing 
X redo the bubbles as overlays ?
V i have to tweak shit for the mat graphs to work?
X drop the mod indicators from matrices? -> repaint on_voice/_cv_param_changed
V the repaint framerate is too slow probably bc it repaint slow..
V limit listeners for params to that param?
V the kick in demo 2 not renders good
V modulation distortion demo bolletjes not render good => need to filter event shit on the audio side. it goes backwards in time on the gui
V recheck the is fx and the clap
* update the docs for cpu stuff
* update the mod demo video

wishlist:
filter microtuning
DSF falloff to the left
clap polyphonic modulation
full-blown renoise support
fix global unison for mono mode
ditch after-mod, claim micro support ?
show effective modulation in the ui for clap param mod
Feedback FM - but needs per-sample processing, not block
turn on stuff when dragging (e.g. basic sin, dist skew etc)
arpeggiator - hard - but easy -> play multiple octaves on-note. or maybe allow 3/s, 5/s, whatever selection
bugfix: rerender graph on master in param hover?
repaint on waveform change (free running or random-per-voice)

wishlist sometime:
mseg
midi mpe
.com website 
cheby shaper
phaser/flanger/chorus
vst3 note expressions
flstudio clap support
show clap mod indicator
visual routing indicators
automated regression tests
better studiorack integration
do async clear delay lines etc on patch select
global unit lfo phase offset not plot good
