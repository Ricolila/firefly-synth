sometimes:
update hosts
update submodules
cpu/mem profiling

on release: 
1 dont forget to update the version nr in code and cmake and mac bundle and build/zip scripts and studiorack and site
2 drop all conversion code on breaking plugin id
3 run some debug builds
4 add missing presets from demos
5 update all renoise stuff
6 upload new binaries
7 update screenshots
8 update the history
9 check if need update github social preview
10 mail to self
11 dont forget to tag
12 make a github release
13 update kvr 
14 update the website

microtuning:
* check up on andreyas comments

autobuilds:
* ask paul
* integrate https://github.com/surge-synthesizer/monique-monosynth/blob/main/.github/workflows/build-pr.yml

modvis take 3:
* make a new one for free-run and on-voice-rand

arp
V do updown/downup 2 modes (repeat end note or not)
V do +-/3 oct
V do the flip-each-N control
V do the multinote thing
V controls2: oct low/oct high (or maybe just 1 combo for +1/+2/+3/-1/-2/-3/+-1,+-2 etc)
V controls8: the how-many-notes-at-once thingy (cycling ceg as ce-eg-gc)
V shit cannot do note length --> that requires noteid not all hosts have it
V what is up with the cpu usage?
V make sure globuni works
V do up-down-updown-random-seq(=custom)
V do octave counter + range
V why only play single note, can be any combination out of the active chord (e.g. cdef = c, d, e, f or cd, de, ef, fc or cde, def, efc, fcd etc)
V do the disable controls thing
V up the vno
X controls6: the length (in time / bars / both) + allow some randomization and/or global-cv?
V do 4 random modes free yn/fix yn
V do notes and select to first section
V do "select" eg 1234  -> 12345, 12131415, 12123123412345 ==> next/bounce/build
X do the lookahead window to bundle events
X 16-step-seq
X make global/voice in uppercase
X or all tab headers in uppercase?
X can do hold each N + release yea/no as mini-sequ bc no ui space
V do simple mod-by for the "lfo" time?
X do something like note-mode + table-mode
V do good tooltips
X make a header section for the master section
V order netjes de controls
X can do note HOLD
X do TOOLTIP when hover menu item
V controls0 => once build up the table: PLAY = forward/backward/random-and-or-cv-sampling => also starting table pos would be nice ? => also random start pos nice
V controls1: off-up-down-updown-downup-random (with what prng? or maybe rand + global cv's) ==> not random, just any cv source. let user model with random GLFO
X controls3: the timing thingy
X controls4: the not-so-sequencer thingy
V controls5: the speed (in time / bars / both) + allow some randomization and/or global-cv?
X controls7: some kinda step editor ==> also instead can do hold & skip ? ==> scan & skip (e.g. scan 1, skip 0 plays as natural)
V do some nice stuff with the global cv sources, they there for grabs already
V lfo not usable ==> give it its own internal lfo, reset in table start ==> also sync it to the master stream pos
V the osc mod controls are tiny ?
V output the table pos as cv signal!
X do small graph under the VOICE OUT section
V rename abs/rel
X still do something with note lengths/hold/stop/whatever ==> make the sequ
V remove any mention of seq
V fix the rand crash
V also maybe have some visualization! 
V plot multiple notes
V add ARP label to the graph
V show what is off
V make arp label not ugly
V smaller graphs
V give all graphs the same fontsize 
V do arp outs as on-note!
V cvout still no good
X another option ==> do "ignore" (float NaN?) for cv graph also for midi and clap mod ==> yes! do notexist/poison buffer
V check if the EXP length is good
X maybe hard reset all chans for renoise ?
V still not killing all the notes
V reset is still no good

* fix the midi graph
* single-note arp not always goes off
* show arp label as chord ceg-whatever
* fix the gaux123456 graphs
* review code, make detailed release notes
* fix repaint stuff on global in param drag it always shows aux1
* compare perf with regular play notes
* check automation works
* check if shows up in the docs
* write the manual
* do more kbd tracking
* add arp table pos as a mod source ==> yes do it + also make all graphs react pfft

wishlist:
use fftw
make a patch cleanup button
update the manuals routing overview image with new colors
filter microtuning
DSF falloff to the left
clap polyphonic modulation
full-blown renoise support
fix global unison for mono mode
ditch after-mod, claim micro support ?
show effective modulation in the ui for clap param mod
Feedback FM - but needs per-sample processing, not block
turn on stuff when dragging (e.g. basic sin, dist skew etc)

wishlist sometime:
mseg
midi mpe
cheby shaper
phaser/flanger/chorus
vst3 note expressions
flstudio clap support
show clap mod indicator
visual routing indicators
automated regression tests
better studiorack integration
do async clear delay lines etc on patch select
global unit lfo phase offset not plot good
