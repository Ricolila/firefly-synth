always:
dont forget to tag
update the history
keep cpu/mem profiling
drop all conversion code on breaking plugin id
dont forget to update the version nr in code and cmake

someday:
mseg
midi mpe
microtonal
.com website 
cheby shaper
voice level unison
cakewalk bug report
phaser/flanger/chorus
incorporate mts-esp
vst3 note expressions
clap (poly) modulation
visual routing indicators
document the header files a bit
out gain/cpu meter
basic osc waveform icons
solo osc/fx
group cv matrix targets by e.g. gaudio gain 1-10
do basic theming support (e.g. config file with colors)
normalized_to_raw/plain => no need to trigger the exponential conversion stuff on each sample, just when automation/modulation changed
=> how ? if done in plugin_base, lose out on inlining, if done in firefly, needs more scratch space

v1.3:
sliders in all matrices to knobs
todo add big pad 2 preset
default global keytrack to 0
prettify the edit controls section
rename preset->load preset
automate zip/dist
move route up/down
copy voice<->global
osc graph does not vertical fill?
do copy/paste patch through clipboard
bug: preset select jumps back to previous
do async clear delay lines etc on patch select
do forward compat checks - dont load newer versions

other:
profile the pad preset
CLAP gui not showing on qtractor/fedora
do indexed release schema + regular backwards compat
