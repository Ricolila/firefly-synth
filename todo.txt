(polyphonic) modulation
handle clap midi notes
handle clap is_modulatable
do cakewalk bug report

demo synth:
do clap midi notes
polymod/mpe/note_exprs
read all the comments from github and kvr and forums
make new test files
fix up the gui (control sizes etc)
check all infernal functionality, see what needs to be in the base
document the header files a bit
negative cv amount
fully do the cv matrix with offset/spread
more space for freq slider
number modules by processing order or by group
implement the multi env
poly/poly port sync/poly port time/mono port sync/mono port time (fake mono only)
do incdecbuttons on cent?
voice arp?
more flexibility in plugin_base -> "give me a voice"
hardsync, unison
do 5 am and 5 fm routes
make all stuff visible / not tabbed
do mseg someday
do different ui layout, larges graphs, load/save/preset etc on 1 line below graphs
drop "or time into scratch" & friends?
am clicks on low freq
make the matrices smaller -- too much vertical noise now
revert to 1 graph per module section
still repaint the graph on module-hover and depending on section on param-hover
move the matrix graph below the matrices
drop the graph tooltips
graph off vs no data

* get some linux folks to comment (ycollete?)
* continuing
- check all param_automate
- measure performance
- keep updating the demo stuff

* host bugs:
- waveform: lots, not supported
- cakewalk, renoise: ui interaction gets lost (does not end up as inputParameterChanges) (also for load state from ui)
