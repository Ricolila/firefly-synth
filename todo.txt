vnext next:
Title not visible on renoise mac
flstudio beta CLAP automation test is broken, retest when the thing is released
do not include plugin version in the name, waveform seeks for it
do automated tests somehow
bug: preset select jumps back to previous
do forward compat checks - dont load newer versions
do async clear delay lines etc on patch select -> 
  idea: since all the reset/reload stuff seems kinda fuzzy and different between clap/vst3:
  add a hidden readonly int parameter acting as a random token and flush stuff on the dsp side when it changes?

other:
CLAP gui not showing on qtractor/fedora
do indexed release schema + regular backwards compat
