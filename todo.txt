sometimes:
update hosts
update submodules
cpu/mem profiling

on release: 
1 dont forget to update the version nr in code and cmake and mac bundle and build/zip scripts and studiorack
2 drop all conversion code on breaking plugin id
3 run some debug builds
4 add missing presets from demos
5 update all renoise stuff
6 upload new binaries
7 update screenshots
8 update the history
9 check if need update github social preview
10 dont forget to tag
11 make a github release
12 update kvr 

microtuning:
* check up on andreyas comments

autobuilds:
* ask paul
* integrate https://github.com/surge-synthesizer/monique-monosynth/blob/main/.github/workflows/build-pr.yml

ui-vnext:
* shit i still need param_was_modded_this_round/voice, otherwise stuff sticks
* ditch after-mod, claim micro support ?
* maybe just paint all of graphs on 60 fps ?
* also do the audio matrix graphs
* also include the mod-mod matrix events
* test with disable/enable routes (param_is_modded event)
* todo show all voices or only last
* make the cv graphs + bolletjes work in case of automation
* global unit lfo phase offset not plot good
* less ugly audio graphs
* show clap mod indicator
* repaint on waveform change (free running or random-per-voice)
* show active modulation for the other graphs -> better to have a separate state copy including modulation
* bugfix: rerender graph on master in param hover?
* show effective modulation in the ui for clap param mod

wishlist:
filter microtuning
DSF falloff to the left
clap polyphonic modulation
full-blown renoise support
fix global unison for mono mode
Feedback FM - but needs per-sample processing, not block
turn on stuff when dragging (e.g. basic sin, dist skew etc)
arpeggiator - hard - but easy -> play multiple octaves on-note. or maybe allow 3/s, 5/s, whatever selection

wishlist sometime:
mseg
midi mpe
.com website 
cheby shaper
phaser/flanger/chorus
vst3 note expressions
flstudio clap support
visual routing indicators
automated regression tests
better studiorack integration
do async clear delay lines etc on patch select
