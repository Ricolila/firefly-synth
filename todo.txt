* get some linux folks to comment (ycollete?)
* continuing
- check all param_automate
- measure performance
- keep updating the demo stuff

* host bugs:
- waveform: lots, not supported
- cakewalk, renoise: ui interaction gets lost (does not end up as inputParameterChanges) (also for load state from ui)
