V split smoothing params to separate module
V + do the conversion
V pretty up the master module
V make it a settings tab
V and hopefully get the nfr
V drop mstin params
V fix the stylesheets
V fix the tab width
V do mts mode in glbal settings section
V fix the fx gui
- show mts status in output section
- fix the renoise demos
- make note continuous
- check if it can be made a better mod source
- refix all the patches
- figure out how to interpolate/modulate
- deal with kbdtrack and anything else that might be affected
- not forget to install the dynlib on mac/lin
- deal with unmapped keys
- fix the todos
- do NOT use the tuning table when "Off", or - make sure it gives the same results with lerp
- rename note_to_freq=>no_tuning, select version based on template params
- ask oli about the possibility to do 1 IPC call for the entire tuning table
- test the heck out of the clap threadpool
- fix the tuning table at block start, copy over the whole thing at voice start, before threadpool kicks in -- and link it 1:1 to tuning mode.
==> do NOT requery tuning mode anywhere else except where the actual table is filled !
- yes or no on per-channel retuning ?
=> tuning -> retuning. reserve tuning for interpolation mode

wishlist:
green-on-white UI
DSF falloff to the left
clap polyphonic modulation
full-blown renoise support
fix global unison for mono mode
fixed random at voice start as mod source
Feedback FM - but needs per-sample processing, not block
turn on stuff when dragging (e.g. basic sin, dist skew etc)
arpeggiator - hard - but easy -> play multiple octaves on-note. or maybe allow 3/s, 5/s, whatever selection
