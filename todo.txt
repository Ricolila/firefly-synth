sometimes:
update hosts
update submodules
cpu/mem profiling

on release:

2 drop all conversion code on breaking plugin id
3 run some debug builds
4 add missing presets from demos

mseg lfo:
* up the vno
* allow phase adjust for global
* vlfo not paint good for static 1
* what is usable: sync, step, smooth, snap (how to snap ?)
* what is not usable: skew x/y, shape, seed, phase
* left panel becomes: [sync, step, smooth, snap (glfo only)]
* right panel becomes: [skew x/y, shape, seed, phase (vlfo only)] or MSEG 
* deal with oneshot (not onephase)
* deal with the filter stage
* deal with the fx version (glfo)

microtuning:
* check up on andreyas comments

autobuilds:
* ask paul
* sign the mac version
* integrate https://github.com/surge-synthesizer/monique-monosynth/blob/main/.github/workflows/build-pr.yml

shortlist:
make it work in ableton
mseg as lfo
do the kvr arm64 thing
update all hosts and dependencies
ditch after-mod, claim micro support ?
arp new note = reset table pos yes/no?
do more keyboard tracking just do it -- also trackmode mul/add
do global unison subvoice index as a mod source
turn on stuff when dragging (e.g. basic sin, dist skew etc)

wishlist:
use fftw
should figure out a way to do user supplied formulas?
update the manuals routing overview image with new colors
make a patch cleanup button
update the routing graph for arp
filter micro tuning
DSF falloff to the left
clap polyphonic modulation
full-blown renoise support
fix global unison for mono mode
show effective modulation in the ui for clap param mod
Feedback FM - but needs per-sample processing, not block

wishlist sometime:
midi mpe
cheby shaper
phaser/flanger/chorus
vst3 note expressions
flstudio clap support
show clap mod indicator
visual routing indicators
automated regression tests
better studiorack integration
do async clear delay lines etc on patch select
