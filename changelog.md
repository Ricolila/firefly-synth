### ?, ? - V1.8.2.

- Add new modulation source: on-voice-random (inside the on-note menu).
This is a fixed value at voice start but differs from on-note-global-random-lfo
in that it is re-drawn for each voice. So, you have to play chords to hear it's effect.

### July 6, 2024 - V1.8.1.

- Add some presets.
- Add another demo tune to go with it.
- Split oscillator AM/FM gui to separate tabs.

### July 1, 2024 - V1.8.0.

- Added logging.
- Add some more presets.
- Add another demo tune to go with it.
- Renamed unipolar acid preset.
- Switched to static linking of MSVCRT on windows.
- Added backwards FM + renamed bipolar -> through-zero + renamed unipolar -> forwards.
- Bugfix: FX version tried to read global unison params causing the plugin to crash on windows 11.
- Changed location of user settings (gui size and selected theme). Also these are no longer shared between clap/vst3.

### June 11, 2024 - V1.7.9 (No binaries).

- Add some presets.
- Add a demo tune to go with it.

### June 8, 2024 - V1.7.8 (With binaries).
### June 6, 2024 - V1.7.8 (No binaries).

- Bugfix + breaking change: 
Oscillator gain modulation was applied on osc-unison-sum level,
but AM and FM are applied per osc-unison-voice. This basically
rendered per-oscillator gain useless for AM/FM amount control.
The new setup much more closely resembles the FM "operator"
approach, but is unfortunately a breaking change.

### June 3, 2024 - V1.7.7.

- Flipped automation smoothing / other smoothing gui.
- Changed linux distribution to .zip instead of .tar.gz.
- Don't crash on missing resources, just make the gui look ugly.
- Add readme.txt that explains to copy all resources, not just the binary.

### May 22, 2024 - V1.7.6 (With binaries).
### May 16, 2024 - V1.7.6 (No binaries).

- Add some presets.

### May 9, 2024 - V1.7.5.

- Add CLAP modulation support. Only global, not per-voice yet!
- Add automation smoothing parameter in addition to MIDI and BPM smoothing. Reacts to CLAP modulators too, this is mainly useful for host-provided square lfo's etc.
- Breaking change: changed the way parameter smoothing works. This will not break the plugin proper but may have small audible differences w.r.t. previous versions.

### April 29, 2024 - V1.7.4 (No binaries).

- Added waveform 13 to the list of supported hosts. No idea if some update between waveform 12 and 13 fixed it, or there was a bug on firefly's side that got fixed.
- Unfortunately still no renoise and cakewalk.

### April 28, 2024 - V1.7.3.

- Swapped envelope sustain and smoothing in the gui.
- Bugfix: Shrunk FX title size to fit on mac.
- Bugfix: Do not store plugin settings directly under linux user home folder.
- Bugfix: internal block splitting did not respect sample accurate automation.
- Bugfix: automation changes were reported back to the host, which caused automation to stop working entirely in bitwig and flstudio.

### April 22, 2024 - V1.7.2.

- Updated dependencies to latest (juce, vst3, clap).
- Bugfix: the windows .zip archives are now actually .zip archives, not zipped .tar files.
- Breaking change: reduced max oversampling to 4x to cut down on memory usage.
- Breaking change: reduced max voice count from 128 to 64 (more memory cutdown). Global unison voices also come out of the 64 available!
- Split up internal processing into multiple fixed size buffers to not have memory usage dependent on the host buffer size.
-- This costs a bit of cpu, hopefully not too bad.

### April 13, 2024 - V1.7.1.

- Changed built-in themes (and dropped some).

### April 10, 2024 - V1.7.0.

- Rearranged the gui to have elements more aligned.
- Changed default distortion mode to plain tanh clipper.
- Renamed distortion skew in/out to x/y to align with lfo.
- Add additional global aux parameter just to fit the gui.
- Bugfix: disable envelope trigger for polyphonic mode.
- Bugfix: disable global unison parameters when voice count is 1.
- Bugfix + breaking change: when global unison is enabled voices are attenuated by sqrt(voice-count).

### April 2, 2024 - V1.6.1.

- Add Intel Mac support.

### March 31, 2024 - V1.6.0.

- Add Mac support. Apple silicon only, no Intel Macs yet!

### March 28, 2024 - V1.5.1 (No binaries).

- Add new preset (big pad 3 with global unison).

### March 27, 2024 - V1.5.0.

- Add global unison support. 
  Heavy on the cpu, benefits from CLAP threadpool.

### March 24, 2024 - V1.4.1.

- Add some color schemes.
- Add version info to gui.
- Add system DPI awareness.
- Increase undo history size.
- Organize presets in folders.
- Copy/paste patch from system clipboard.

### March 18, 2024 - V1.4.0.

- Add some soft clippers.

### March 15, 2024 - V1.3.1.

- Add some themes (just basic color schemes).

### March 14, 2024 - V1.3.0.

- Add theming support.
- Add 4 themes: current, current flat, infernal, infernal flat (re-introduced everyone's favourite creepy images!)
- Added a new preset.

### March 10, 2024 - V1.2.4 (No binaries).

- Swap out native message boxes for juce alert windows so they react to content scaling.

### March 10, 2024 - V1.2.3 (No binaries).

- Bugfix: undo menu did not react to content scaling.

### March 9, 2024 - V1.2.2 (No binaries).

- Change max ui scale factor from 200% to 800%.

### March 8, 2024 - V1.2.1.

- Add big pad 2 preset.
- Scale back default ui width to 1280.
- Bugfix: osc graph scales to 100% * gain.
- Bugfix: default global SVF keyboard tracking to 0.
- UI scaling from 50% to 200% (was 100 to unlimited).

### March 6, 2024 - V1.2.0.

- Lots of small ui fixes / cleanup.
- Rename saw waveshaper to off.
- Add 2 extra master cv aux parameters.
- Fixed a bug in the triangle waveshaper.
- Drop square waveshaper (bug, it shouldn't have been there).
- Comb filter gets additional mode select (feedback/feedforward/both).
- Split out combined comboboxes to separate controls:
  - NOTE! This is a breaking change for automation on those parameters.
  - LFO mode + sync.
  - Delay mode + sync.
  - LFO shape + skew controls.
  - FX Type + distortion mode.
  - Envelope type + slope mode.
  - Distortion shaper + skew controls.
- Rearranged lfo/distortion shape options
  - NOTE! This is a breaking change for automation on this parameter.

Even though there are some breaking changes I decided *against* changing the plugin id,
because breaking changes relate to automation of discrete-valued parameters only.
Regular loading of projects/preset files applies the appropriate conversion from previous formats.
